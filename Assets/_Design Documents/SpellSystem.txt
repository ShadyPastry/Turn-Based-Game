The three core objects in the SpellSystem are "Runes", "Spellpages", and "Spellbooks"

//
//Runes
//

A Rune is an association between "SpellAttributes" and "energy"

SpellAttributes affect the characteristics of a spell, e.g.
  Damage type: "Fire", "Ice", and "Volt" attributes
  Minimum and maximum damage: "Stability" and "Power" attributes

Energy is just an integer, e.g. 5 points of fire energy

An example Rune could be "Wildfire"
  10 points of Fire energy
  5 points of Power energy
  -2 points of Stability energy

Also note that I have yet to finalize what kind of SpellAttributes I want there to be


//
//Spellpages
//

A Spellpage is an arrangement of Runes on a 2D grid.  It can be used to cast a spell, whose effects depend on...
  The energy of the contained Runes
  The positions of the contained Runes


//
//Spellbooks
//

A Spellbook can contain Runes, Spellpages, and SpellAttribute energy
  A Rune inside a Spellbook can be "cast", which can add to / subtract from the energy in the Spelbook

  A Spellpage inside a Spellbook can be used to cast a spell, which consumes energy
    Naturally, the spell cannot be cast if there isn't enough energy


//
//System goals
//

I'd like the flow of spell-based combat to be as follows:
  OUTSIDE OF COMBAT
    Design Spellpages
    Decide what Runes to store in your Spellbook
  IN COMBAT
    Spend time/resources prepping your Spellpages
      The cost of prepping depends on how compatible your Spellbook's Runes are with the Spellpage
    Once prepped, cast them repeatedly and freely (move away from the traditional TP system in so many games)

In combat, I'd want to design encounters such that the kind of spells you want to use change within the encounter
  e.g. maybe an enemy starts out weak to fire, but its weakness changes to ice at < 1/2 HP

Out of combat, I'd like to design regions that encourage the use of different types of spells, e.g.
  flying enemies primarily weak to volt vs. icy enemies primarily weak to fire
  high evasion enemies vs. high defence enemies


My current idea for "prepping" spells is needing to "activate" them before they can be used
  Activating (and deactivating) requires time
  There's a cap on how many spells can be activated at once
    Stronger/more complex spells contribute more towards that cap
    Deactivating a spell fully undoes the contribution towards the cap
